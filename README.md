# pixelated

Pixelated is the project that myself and my team made in our participation on KFUPM Innovation hackathon.
it is a P2P app that gives students the ability to order and deliver meals from the students restaurant from and to other students.
Since the students restuarant is dine in only, the app when lunched will give the ability to have a take away order.  
Secondly, no more time wasted in a queue. With our app, you can go to your room on compus and your meal will be delivered to you!
At the same time, you can be a deliverer and earn some money by delivering other students meals!
